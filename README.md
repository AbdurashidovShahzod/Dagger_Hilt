# Dagger_Hilt
Hilt provides a standard way to incorporate Dagger dependency injection into an Android application.

The goals of Hilt are:

To simplify Dagger-related infrastructure for Android apps.
To create a standard set of components and scopes to ease setup, readability/understanding, and code sharing between apps.
To provide an easy way to provision different bindings to various build types (e.g. testing, debug, or release).
